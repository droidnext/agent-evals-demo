"""
Agents module - Now using ADK structure.

The old custom agent classes have been archived.
Use the ADK-compliant agents in agents/cruise_booking/ instead.

For ADK usage:
    adk web agents/ --port 8000
    adk run agents/cruise_booking/

For compatibility with existing scripts, see agents.compat module.
"""

# This module is intentionally minimal
# All agent logic is now in agents/cruise_booking/ (ADK structure)
